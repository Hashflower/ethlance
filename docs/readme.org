* Quickstart
  While in this folder, run on the commandline:
  ~make~

  *Or*

  From the main ethlance repository:
  ~make build-docs~

* Publishing
  Results can be published to IPFS as a static website:
  ~make publish-ipfs~

  *Or*

  From the main ethlance repository:
  ~make publish-docs~

* Prerequisites
 - java on commandline ~which java~
 - emacs on commandline ~which emacs~
 - graphviz on commandline ~which dot~
   - Ubuntu:  ~sudo apt-get install graphviz~
   - Mac:     ~brew install graphviz~
   - Other:   [[https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/][Download Page]]
 - plantuml.jar
   - *Note* already included in ./bin folder
 - *Optional* ipfs on commandline ~which ipfs~
   - While running an IPFS daemon
   - Used for publishing results

* Rationale 
  This directory contains scripts to generate documentation with
  ~make~. This folder is meant to serve as a drop-in tool to use with
  District0x projects for managing High-level design and specification
  documentation, with enough flexibility to include diagrams from
  third-party tooling.

* How it Works

** Plant Files
   *.plant files placed in the ~./plant~ folder are compiled and
   placed in ./diagrams folder as *.png and *.svg files of the same
   name.

   For Example, ~./plant/test.plant~ would generate the files
   - ~./org/images/test.png~
   - ~./org/images/test.svg~

** Org Files
   *.org files placed in the ~./org~ folder are compiled and placed in
   ~./public/html~ as compiled HTML. Additionally, images are also
   copied to ~./public/html/images~
